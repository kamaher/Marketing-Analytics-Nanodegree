A 50% stickiness ratio indicates the average customer used the online app or website 15 of the 30 days in that month. In contrast, a .01 stickiness ratio indicates the average customer used the online app or website only one day that month.
A higher stickiness ratio indicates the website or online app is engaging the customers.

Stickiness = Daily Active Users/ Monthly Active Users
It is a useful KPI for management and investors. It tells the management what is their company's growth rate. Investors want to know if this online app or website has potential to make money in the future. For example, if the plan is to introduce advertising into the app, the potential valuation will depend on whether the app has a large number of users that keep coming back to it.

Criticisms of Stickiness
It is important to note that there are also criticisms of some of these metrics. Let's review those for a moment:

One argument is that stickiness doesn't tease out the depth of engagement. It does not give much detail on what the users are doing. If the metric is based solely on whether users logged in, then it doesn't tell you if the user is just viewing, or using a website feature. When you are analyzing your website's engagement levels for a specific feature of your website, stickiness cannot help you distinguish between engagement levels for specific features.

In the start-up phase, not too much emphasis should be placed on this metric. It does not give an accurate metric of a reliable count of MAU because companies are in the marketing stage to get their name out.

Stickiness is not a useful metric when the app is not meant to be used monthly. For e.g., for a travel app where you need to book your flights for travel but since most people travel only a few times a year - at least for non-business purpose, this metric does not serve its purpose well.",,,,,,,,,,
